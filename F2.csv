"I need to start this review by stating 1) I can't stand self-help books and 2) I'm a feminist (no, I don't hate men- some men are quite awesome, but I am very conscious of women and our place in the world.",,
"The problem with this book is not just that it's bad, which it certainly is, but that there are so many people out there who want to corner you at parties and tell you how it's totally changed their lives. In a way you might as well read it just so you can see how feeble-minded they must be to get any kind of philosophical nourishment out of this inexhaustible stream of clichés. The profound lessons you'll learn from this book amount to nothing more than several variations on the theme of only the very ugly is truly beautiful, only the very stupid are really intelligent, only black is white, only up is down etc etc.",,
"His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.",,
"If books were pills, Alchemist would be a sugarcoated placebo with no real effect. Let's call it a feel-good homily. I have never read a book as meretricious as this one. Many reviewers have pointed out the problems with this celebrated novel so I'd rather not expend any more words. Suffice it so say that this is a good example of portentous writing that is best avoided if your benchmark is quality literature.",,
All those negative reviews are baffling to me. Where does it say this is a self help book? People are bashing the lessons as if this is some philosophical or religious work. It's a fictional story that can be enjoyed by yourself or with your kids for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. It's a fun story filled to the brim with quirks and marvels. I was curious the entire time how following one's legend blindly would turn out for the boy. Am I going to now follow my dreams without logic and reason as in the story? No. Because I'm not a crazy person. Get over it. It's just a story and a good one at that.,,
"I don’t believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author’s note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.",,
"I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don’t believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman’s experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s harrowing depiction of abuse in My Dark Vanessa, the tone of It Ends With Us feels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.",,
"It Ends With Us has the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover’s attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of “Naked Truth” to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily’s relationship with Atlas.",,
"The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse “ends with us” is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn’t black and white, but I don’t think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message of It Ends With Us completely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.",,
This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen!  ,,
"I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.",,
"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of  Prisoners of Fate  (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in  A Distant Promise  and  Girl who Stole the Star  have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like  Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~ ,  Time of the Dreamwatch , and  Chronomantique  (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",,
"I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross",,
"If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.",,
"I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever.  ",,
"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a  worst book  contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on  To Kill a Mockingbird --a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",,
"I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story.",,
"I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!",,
"This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable.",,
"AI A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",,Really good book about finance you should read it.

Can see a difference. Pictures are with a difference of 10 days.",,

I have a huge trust on this product primarily because of the recommendations and also been using it personally for a month now. There aren’t much retinol based products out there so I guess this stands out,,
"On using the product at night the first time I noticed that my skin definitely looks much brighter and it was VERY hydrated. My skin does get the very dry cause of the summers. It was soft and hydrated the next day and also very bright – I had a little glow going! And it’s not irritating. I am a big believer in listening to your skin and giving it what it needs and the olay retinol definitely made the cut!. It’s with long-term use that you really see a difference, especially when it comes to your skin’s texture. My mother recommended it to me and on using it I'm going to recommend it to everyone! this is my second purchase on the same its become a part of my nighttime routine. it a great solution for people who may have tried retinol before and given up. And the price point is a fraction of what I’ve spent on other high-quality retinol in the past, so I can keep it up without spending a fortune.",,

For dull and tired skin this is best. I am reviewing this after its use of 15 days and i must say it gives smooth glowing skin and ofcoure skin looks fresh and healthy,,
"This variant of Nykaa Skin Secrets sheet mask has got a watery consistency as it is a water based sheet mask. It is lightweight and non greasy. Sits on the skin smoothly. Given the fact that both neem and turmeric are the holy grail of skin, no brownie points for guessing that this sheet mask is going to be amazing to even begin with. As for the blemish removal, it's really hard to tell after one use. I'll update once I use it a few more times. But this mask is surely worth investing in. P.S : There was a holistic glow that I could not leave out mentioning.",,
"Writing a review for this sheet mask by Nykaa Naturals, the first thing that is absolutely undeniable is the heavenly smell of this sheet mask. It is a water based sheet mask and is hence non-sticky and lightweight. Since, tulsi and yoghurt are the holy grail of skin, the effect of this sheet mask is invincible too. For clearer, brighter and moisturised skin, this sheet mask can be considered as an absolute gem. I'm surely going to invest again in this one. 5/5 stars automatically hence!",,
Lightweight and non sticky. This toner based sheet mask works amazingly on the skin. Evenly tones the skin and brightens it up. Good for combination skin. A good sheet mask worth investing in.,,
"This variant of Nykaa Unmask Sheet Mask is a water based one and is hence lightweight and non-sticky. Sits smoothly on the skin. The smell isn't a very strong one but is pretty pleasant. After the removal of the mask around 15-20 mins later from putting it on in the face, it didn't make my skin very oily. Moisturises lightly but the glow was pretty much appreciable. Inflammation disappeared pertaining to its calming effect. 5 upon 5 for this sheet mask, for it does what it claims. Surely worth trying.",,
"Like the ingredients claim, this variant of Nykaa Naturals sheet mask does just the same. It is lightweight. Smells nice and is non sticky on the skin. An amazing water based sheet mask that made the skin glowing in a jiffy. I've hence put a 5 star in the review. Go for it if you're looking for nourishment.",,
A good sheet mask worth trying for sure. Revitalizes the skin making it radiant and glowing.,,
"Like the mask claims, it does so to the skin. Even if the blemishes are not all gone (which is practically impossible just after one-time use), they certainly are lightened. Patches are lighter too. Will definitely buy again. It is a good product. Certainly worth investigating in.",,
This is awesome so hydrating so soft and damped in skin properly . My face glow like serum face .,,
"Really very happy with the result. It makes my skin very soft, hydrated and glowing. Light weight and non sticky. It gives instant glow to the face. It changes the game in 15-20 minutes. I totally love this sheet mask. Definitely you go for it.",,

"This variant of Nykaa Skin Secrets Sheet Mask is hands down the best one. The best one in the lot. If only I could, I'd have rated it 10 upon 5. By the time I came across this one, I've already used all the other variants and now I can vouch for this one safely. It is serum based sheet mask and hence the consistency is a bit thick and isn't very lightweight. But hey, it's alright and is absolutely necessary to feed the skin sometimes with food apart from just water. The smell is heavenly tbh. As we all know that hyaluronic acid is the holy grail for skin, no wonder that this sheet mask was going amazing to even begin with. Used it at night post cleaning the face with my regular cleanser. I used a toner before applying the sheet mask. That way the mask sits better on the skin. The glow amazed me. For real! Moisturised skin in a jiffy as well. Certainly going to buy it again. Pretty soon too!",,
Very good and hydrating. And the aroma of rose is just wow. Thank you nykaa,,

"Gives a satisfactory feeling after every wash. Although the 100ml tube doesn't last for a month, applying twice a day! Still it'll be included in my skin care always.",,
"This is a good face wash, it removes dirt, dust and oil from the face. It instantly makes the face clear, glowing and bright. Using twice a day removes spots from the face. Must try.",,
I always use this and i see the differences between 15 days to 1 month its so good,,
Very Mild on my skin.Use day and night creams followed by cleansing twice a day.,,
"After first 2-3 uses it left my face smooth and glowing, but after that it causes white flakes on my face and the skin has also turned rough at some places and I have a mixture skin type- oily on nose , chin and under eyes and dry on cheeks.",,
Trusted product since four years now It's so gentle on skin that my skin feels revived each time I use it I judt completely love it,,

I ordered the 7ml one to try if it suits my skin or no And it literally did wonders It’s good for combination - T zone type and ideal for sensitive skin",,
"This is my to go routine. I cannt miss this. It makes ur skin even toned. ofcourse it takes time. You have to trust the process. Its amazing, most importantly don’t forget to apply moisturiser on top of it.",,

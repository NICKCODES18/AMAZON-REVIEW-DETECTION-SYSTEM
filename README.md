AMAZON REVIEW DETECTION SYSTEM
📌 Overview
This project focuses on classifying reviews as real or fake using machine learning techniques implemented with Scikit-learn and data processing via pandas. The model is trained and evaluated on datasets containing labeled reviews, aiming to detect deceptive or fraudulent reviews automatically.
📁 Files
•	CODE.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for preprocessing, training, evaluating, and visualizing results.
•	F1.csv: First dataset containing labeled reviews.
•	F2.csv: Second dataset (if applicable) used for either training/testing or additional evaluation.
•	README.md: Project documentation.
🔧 Technologies Used
•	Python
•	pandas
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualization)
•	Jupyter Notebook
📊 Dataset
The datasets consist of text reviews and their corresponding labels:
•	Label 1: Real Review
•	Label 0: Fake Review
🧠 Workflow
1.	Data Loading
Using pandas to load and inspect CSV datasets.
2.	Preprocessing
o	Cleaning text (removal of punctuation, lowercase conversion, etc.)
o	Tokenization
o	Vectorization using TfidfVectorizer
3.	Model Training
o	Classification algorithms such as:
	Logistic Regression
	Naive Bayes
	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
o	Train/test split using train_test_split
4.	Evaluation
o	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
o	Confusion Matrix
o	Cross-validation (optional)
5.	Prediction
o	The model is used to classify unseen review data.
✅ How to Run
1.	Clone or download the repository.
2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook CODE.ipynb.
3.	Ensure F1.csv and F2.csv are in the same directory.
4.	Run all cells to see the results.
📌 Requirements
Install the required packages before running the notebook:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
📈 Example Output
•	Model Accuracy: e.g., 92%
•	Confusion Matrix showing True/False Positives and Negatives
